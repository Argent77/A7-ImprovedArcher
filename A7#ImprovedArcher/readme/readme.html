        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>The original Archer kit does not scale very well with progressing levels. While the kit is very strong in the earlier parts of the game, it becomes less useful compared to other ranger kits later on.</p>
        <p>This mod attempts to rebalance the kit, so that low level archers don't outshine other classes, while high-level archers may still keep up with other ranger kits. The mod adjusts overall power of the Archer and adds a couple of useful skills and abilities to the kit.</p>
        <p>Additional components provide you with Archer-like kits for figher, paladin and thief classes, or install a set of powerful bows and ammunition to the game.</p>
        <p>The mod is available for BG2, BGT, BG:EE, BG2:EE, EET (Enhanced Edition Trilogy) and IWD:EE.</p>

        <h2>Installation</h2>
        <p>This is a WeiDU mod, that means it is very easy to install. Simply unpack the zip file into the installation directory of your game and run either <em>"setup-A7#ImprovedArcher.exe"</em> (Windows) or <em>"setup-A7#ImprovedArcher.command"</em> (macOS). Follow the instructions, and you are ready to start. It is strongly recommended to start a new game to enjoy all the benefits of the improved Archer kit.</p>
        <p>To uninstall, run <em>"setup-A7#ImprovedArcher.exe"</em> or <em>"setup-A7#ImprovedArcher.command"</em> again and follow the prompts.</p>
        <hr class="doublespacer" />
        <h3>Compatibility</h3>
        <p>There are no compatibility issues known so far. However, the name of the thief kit "Sharpshooter" is also used by a similar kit from the mod "Song &amp; Silence" which results in two identical kit entries to choose from if both components are installed at the same time.</p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> It is not recommended to use more than one mod that overhauls the original Archer kit at a time.</p>

          <p>The Archer is the epitome of skill with the bow-the ultimate marksman, able to make almost any shot, no matter how difficult. To become so skilled with the bow, the Archer has had to sacrifice some of his proficiency with melee weapons and armor.</p>

          </ul>

          <p><strong>CREATE BLESSED AMMUNITION:</strong> Create a spiritual arrow or bolt blessed by the Archer's worshipped god or goddess for 8 hours containing one score of charges. Number of charges doubles at levels 8 and 16 respectively.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>4th level: +1 enchantment, +1 to hit and damage rolls, additional 1d6 damage and slow for two rounds to undead if failed save vs. Death.</li>

          </ul>
          <hr class="spacer" />
          <p><strong>SURE SHOT (HLA):</strong> High-level Archers have gained perfect control over their ranged weapon of choice which allows them to point out and target vital areas of the opponent with frightening precision and speed. By enabling this ability, the Archer takes up his stance and shoots missiles in rapid succession. For the next 12 seconds this ability sets one's number of attacks per round to 10 and every shot is considered a critical hit. Since this technique requires utmost skill and concentration, the Archer is rooted to the spot for the next two rounds. It can not be used together with other shot abilities.</p>
          <hr class="spacer" />
          <p><strong>SET MISSILE TRAP (HLA):</strong> This ability allows the Archer to set a single powerful spring-loaded missile trap in the chosen location when no hostile creatures are in sight. It does 3d10 missile damage and each 1d10 damage of various elemental types to the unsuspecting creature that sets it off.</p>
          <hr class="spacer" />
          <p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>

          <summary title="Click to show or hide description"><strong>Great Sun-Reacher +3</strong></summary>
          <p>The elves of Evereska are known for their isolationism as much as their skill and bravery in battle.  One of their most well known warriors in human lands was the incredibly accurate archer Bariah Goldendown.  Though the elves will neither confirm nor deny the legend, some human tales state that keen-eyed Bariah never missed a target in battle.  His bow, crafted by his mother, was never given a name that was known outside of the family.  The humans that suffered under its power called it "Great Sun-Reacher," believing that Bariah's arrows could reach into the heavens themselves.  In a battle that many Evereskans are bitter about to this day, Bariah's griffon mount was killed in the sky by the spells of invisible wizards that ambushed an elven patrol.  Though only one mage escaped with his life, he did manage to take Great Sun-Reacher with him.</p>

          <p>Composite longbows are bows whose staves are made from more than one type of material. This gives greater flexibility and makes arrows fired from this bow deliver more damage. In addition to powerful enchantments, the materials used for this particular bow are of especially exquisite quality.
