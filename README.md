## Overview

The original Archer kit does not scale very well with progressing levels. While the kit is very strong in the early 
parts of the game, it becomes less useful compared to the other ranger kits later on.
This mod attempts to rebalance the kit, so that low level archers don't outshine other classes, while high-level
archers may still keep up with other ranger kits. The mod adjusts overall power of the Archer and adds a couple of
useful skills and abilities to the kit.

Additional components provide you with Archer-like kits for figher, paladin and thief classes, or install a set of
powerful bows and ammunition to the game.


## Installation

This is a WeiDU mod, that means it is very easy to install. Simply unpack the zip archive into your game directory and
run either "setup-A7#ImprovedArcher.exe" (on Windows) or "setup-A7#ImprovedArcher" (on Mac OS X).
Follow the instructions and you are ready to start. It is strongly recommended to start a new game to enjoy all the
benefits of the improved Archer kit.


## Components

The mod includes two components:

#### 1. Improved Archer Kit (requires BG2:ToB, BGT, BG:EE, BG:SoD, BG2:EE, EET or IWD:EE)

Improves the Archer kit by balancing stat progression and adding a couple of unique skills and abilities.

#### 2. Add fighter kit: Marksman (requires BG2:ToB, BGT, BG:EE, BG:SoD, BG2:EE, EET or IWD:EE)

#### 3. Add paladin kit: Bow Knight (requires BG2:ToB, BGT, BG:EE, BG:SoD, BG2:EE, EET or IWD:EE)

Adds the paladin kit "Bow Knight" to the game, based on the improvements of the Archer kit.

#### 4. Add thief kit: Sharpshooter (requires BG2:ToB, BGT, BG:EE, BG:SoD, BG2:EE, EET or IWD:EE)

Adds the thief kit "Sharpshooter" to the game, based on the improvements of the Archer kit.

#### 5. Add +4 arrows, bolts and two powerful bows to the game (requires BG2:ToB, BGT, BG2:EE or IWD:EE)

*BG2, BGT, BG2:EE and EET:*
Adds +4 arrows and bolts to a number of stores and creatures in the ToB part of the game as well as to Watcher's Keep.
Adds a powerful longbow somewhere to the third level of Watcher's Keep. Adds an even more powerful composite longbow 
to the outdoor area of Sendai's Enclave.

All components can be installed independently.


## Kit Description

#### Ranger kit: Archer
```
The Archer is the epitome of skill with the bow-the ultimate marksman, able to make almost any shot, no matter 
how difficult. To become so skilled with the bow, the Archer has had to sacrifice some of his proficiency with
melee weapons and armor.

Advantages:
- +1 bonus to hit and damage rolls with any missile weapon as well as to AC vs. missile weapons every 6 levels.
- +5% chance to score a critical hit at level 9, 13 and 18.
- May achieve Grandmastery (5 slots) in longbows, shortbows, and crossbows.
- May use Rooting Shot ability once per day every 4 levels. Can not be used together with other shot abilities.
- May use Power Shot ability once per day every 4 levels, starting at level 8. Can not be used together with
  other shot abilities.
- May use Explosive Shot ability once per day every 4 levels, starting at level 8. Can not be used together
  with other shot abilities.
- May use Create Blessed Ammunition ability once per day every 8 levels, starting at level 4.

ROOTING SHOT: All successful ranged attacks within the next 12 seconds will entangle the target, according to
              the level of the Archer:
 4th level: Target is entangled for three rounds if failed save vs. Spell.
 8th level: Target is entangled for three rounds if failed save vs. Spell at -1 penalty.
 12th level: Target is entangled for four rounds if failed save vs. Spell at -1 penalty.
 16th level: Target is entangled for four rounds if failed save vs. Spell at -2 penalty.
 20th level: Target is entangled for five rounds if failed save vs. Spell at -2 penalty.

POWER SHOT: All successful ranged attacks within the next 12 seconds have a chance to knock back the target,
            according to the level of the Archer:
 8th level: Knock back target if failed save vs. Breath.
 12th level: Knock back target if failed save vs. Breath at -1 penalty.
 16th level: Knock back target if failed save vs. Breath at -2 penalty.
 20th level: Knock back target if failed save vs. Breath at -3 penalty.

EXPLOSIVE SHOT: All successful ranged attacks within the next 12 seconds will explode on impact and cause
                physical damage to nearby targets in 15' range, according to the level of the Archer:
 8th level: 1d4 damage to nearby targets
 12th level: 1d4+2 damage to nearby targets
 16th level: 1d4+4 damage to nearby targets
 20th level: 1d4+6 damage to nearby targets
Caution: Damages enemies, allies and innocent bystanders alike.

CREATE BLESSED AMMUNITION: Create a spiritual arrow or bolt blessed by the Archer's worshipped god or goddess
                           for 8 hours containing one score of charges. Number of charges doubles at levels
                           8 and 16 respectively.
 4th level: +1 enchantment, +1 to hit and damage rolls, additional 1d6 damage and slow for two rounds to
            undead if failed save vs. Death.
 8th level: +1 enchantment, +2 to hit and damage rolls, additional 1d6+2 damage and hold for two rounds to
            undead if failed save vs. Death.
 12th level: +2 enchantment, +2 to hit and damage rolls, additional 1d6+4 damage and instant death to undead
             if failed save vs. Death.
 16th level: +3 enchantment, +3 to hit and damage rolls, additional 1d6+6 damage and instant death to undead
             if failed save vs. Death at -2 penalty.
 20th level: +4 enchantment, +4 to hit and damage rolls, additional 1d6+8 damage and instant death to undead
             if failed save vs. Death at -4 penalty.

SURE SHOT (HLA): High-level Archers have gained perfect control over their ranged weapon of choice which
                 allows them to point out and target vital areas of the opponent with frightening precision and
                 speed. By enabling this ability, the Archer takes up his stance and shoots missiles in rapid
                 succession. For the next 12 seconds this ability sets one's number of attacks per round to 10
                 and every shot is considered a critical hit. Since this technique requires utmost skill and
                 concentration, the Archer is rooted to the spot for the next two rounds. It can not be used
                 together with other shot abilities.

SET MISSILE TRAP (HLA): This ability allows the Archer to set a single powerful spring-loaded missile trap
                        in the chosen location when no hostile creatures are in sight. It does 3d10 missile
                        damage and each 1d10 damage of various elemental types to the unsuspecting creature
                        that sets it off.

Disadvantages:
- -1 CON penalty.
- May not wear any metal armor.
- May only become Proficient (one slot) with melee weapons.

## Longbow Descriptions

**Great Sun-Reacher +3:**
```
The elves of Evereska are known for their isolationism as much as their skill and bravery in battle.  One of
their most well known warriors in human lands was the incredibly accurate archer Bariah Goldendown. Though the
elves will neither confirm nor deny the legend, some human tales state that keen-eyed Bariah never missed a
target in battle.  His bow, crafted by his mother, was never given a name that was known outside of the family.
The humans that suffered under its power called it "Great Sun-Reacher," believing that Bariah's arrows could
reach into the heavens themselves.  In a battle that many Evereskans are bitter about to this day, Bariah's
griffon mount was killed in the sky by the spells of invisible wizards that ambushed an elven patrol.
Though only one mage escaped with his life, he did manage to take Great Sun-Reacher with him.

- Protection From Normal Missiles twice per day

**The Defender +5:**
```
Composite longbows are bows whose staves are made from more than one type of material. This gives greater
flexibility and makes arrows fired from this bow deliver more damage.
In addition to powerful enchantments, the materials used for this particular bow are of especially exquisite
quality. The bow's exceptionally durable frame can be used to deflect even the strongest blows and the
ergonomic design allows the user to shoot missiles in rapid succession.
